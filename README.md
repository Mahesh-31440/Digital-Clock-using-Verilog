# Digital Clock using Verilog

This project implements a **12-hour digital clock** using Verilog HDL. It includes second, minute, and hour counters along with an AM/PM toggle and alarm feature.

## ðŸ§  Components Implemented

- **BCD Counter** for 0â€“9 counting
- **Mod-6 Counter** for minute and second tens place
- **Hour Module** to handle 12-hour format and AM/PM logic
- **Top-level Clock Module** that integrates all submodules and supports alarm functionality

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Resets to 12:00 AM
- Increments seconds â†’ minutes â†’ hours automatically
- Switches AM/PM at 12:00
- Alarm triggers based on provided time match (`r_time`) and AM/PM match (`r_m`)

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- `digital_clock.v` â€” Contains all Verilog modules in one file
- `testbench.v` â€” (Optional) Simulates the functionality of the clock

## ðŸš€ Simulation

This design can be simulated in any Verilog simulator like **Vivado**, **ModelSim**, or **GTKWave**. No FPGA synthesis done yet.
